Issue Creating Guidelines

- Don't submit issues that change the game very differently so it has a different purpose.
- If your issue has to do with only the apps for iOS, Android, or any other platform, please submit the issue in the appropriate repo (e.g. "*add iOS stickers*" would go under the iOS app repo)
- Make sure to include enough information as needed.
- Make sure to be available to respond if needed.

Thanks for contributing!
