# b-Ocracy Contributing Guidelines
b-Ocracy is currently in the beta testing stage, so contributing to our game via GitHub or any other way is very appreciative.
# The Google Group
We have a [Google Group](https://bocracy.com/betatest) for the beta testers that we use to send out announcements and game related information. Please join this group so you can be up to date.

You must be apart of this group in order for your name to be listed as a beta tester in [the credits](https://bocracy.com/credits).
# Testing
You may play on any of our b-Ocracy apps and submit feedback in the form of [Github issues](https://github.com/thebclickteam/bocracy/issues), [Google Group](https://bocracy.com/betatest) discussions, or [email](mailto:team@bocracy.com).

There is also an [alpha release](http://bocracy.tk) that you can play online and send feedback for. Please keep in mind that this site is infrequently different than the normal release.
